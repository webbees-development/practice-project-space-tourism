# practice-project-space-tourism
 
This is a solution for [this challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3/hub/space-tourism-multipage-website-ggFj9EM5yB) from Frontend Mentor. I wanted to try out Astro as Static Site Generator. I implemented some Vue components for the sliders.

The site can be viewed [here](http://test.webbees-test.eu/).
